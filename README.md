# CNN_MNIST
The unfinished project contains implementations of CNN, which is trained on the MNIST dataset. The network is expected to be implemented using Pytorch.nn and Pytorch.Lightning. Up to now, the basic version can be found in Basic_CNN_MNIST.ipyb, which performs poorly. More techniques will be investigated to improve the performance.
